           Installation instructions for AI::Categorizer

To install this module, follow the standard steps for installing most
Perl modules:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

Or you may use the CPAN.pm module, which will automatically execute
these steps for you, and help you get the prerequisite dependencies
installed as well.

Alternatively, you can use the new Module::Build-style installer:

  perl Build.PL
  ./Build
  ./Build test
  ./Build install
