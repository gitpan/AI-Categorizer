Revision history for Perl extension AI::Categorizer.

0.04  Thu Nov  7 19:27:15 AEST 2002

 - Added learners for SVMs, Decision Trees, and a pass-through to
   Weka.

 - Added a virtual class for binary classifiers.

 - Wrote documentation for lots of the undocumented classes.

 - Added a PNG file giving an overview diagram of the classes.

 - Added a script 'categorizer' to provide a simple command-line
   interface to AI::Categorizer

 - save_state() and restore_state() now save to a directory, not a
   file.

 - Removed F1(), precision(), recall(), etc. from Util package since
   they're in Statistics::Contingency.  Added random_elements() to
   Util.

 - Collection::Files now warns when no category information is known
   about a document in the collection (knowing it's in zero categories
   is okay).

 - Added the Collection::InMemory class

 - Much more thorough testing with 'make test'.

 - Added add_hypothesis() method to Experiment.

 - Added dot() and value() methods to FeatureVector.

 - Added 'feature_selection' parameter to KnowledgeSet.

 - Added document($name) accessor method to KnowledgeSet.

 - In KnowledgeSet, load(), read(), and scan_*() can now accept a
   Collection object.

 - Added document_frequency(), finish(), and weigh_features() methods
   to KnowledgeSet.

 - Added save_features() and restore_features() to KnowledgeSet.

 - Added default categories() and categorize() methods to Learner base
   class.  get_scores() is now abstract.

 - Extended interface of ObjectSet class with retrieve(), includes(),
   and includes_name().

 - Moved 'term_weighting' parameter from Document to KnowledgeSet,
   since the normalized version needs to know the maximum
   term-frequency.  Also changed its values to 'n', 'l', 'b', and 't',
   with 'x' a synonym for 't'.

 - Implemented full range of TF/IDF term weighting methods (see Salton
   & Buckley, "Term Weighting Approaches in Automatic Text Retrieval",
   in journal "Information Processing & Management", 1988 #5)
